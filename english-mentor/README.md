# Introduction for new english mentors

Welcome to HackYourFuture! We really appreciate your interest in being part of our community. By volunteering, you contribute to our main goal: help trainees gain the necessary skills to find a job as a programmer. HackYourFuture has now helped over 300 trainees find work as a programmer. This is only possible with the support of our volunteers <3

## Curriculum

To facilitate the learning process, volunteers--together with HYF staff--have developed a curriculum, which you can find [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum). The complete 7-month program is divided into different modules, each building on the one before. We encourage you to have a look at the curriculum so that you know what the trainees are learning. Another useful resource is the [Study Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzPC7m9vOCb0h4EFCqLChw1L096XcbJv3dK3k7VooQM/edit?usp=sharing), which we give to trainees on their introduction day. It provides an overview of our program and might answer some of the questions you still have after reading this sheet. 

## English Mentoring 
Some trainees need additional language support at the end of the course to improve their conversation and interviewing skills. That’s exactly what you provide as an English Mentor. After you have been introduced, you will contact the trainee, agree upon a time and day and start mentoring, we suggest 1 hour a week for a period of 12 weeks (flexible, based on your and your trainee’s availability). Even if you have only half an hour per week, this is still invaluable support for our trainees.

## Practical information
We have an optional bi-weekly meeting with fellow English Mentors and the HackYourFuture team to gather feedback and ask questions. The number of weeks for which the trainee needs English support varies per trainee, and additionally how quickly they find an internship, but generally they are back on track after a month or so, with a maximum of 12 weeks’ support.
