# Introduction
Some trainees need additional support throughout the course as the speed of our program is a challenge for them. That’s exactly what you provide as a coding mentor. You do so by making +/- 2 video calls during the week.  
[This document](video-call-guide.md) provides a structure to help you give the right support. 

## Practical information
You have about two video calls each week that you plan together with the trainee. Normally, a call lasts approximately two hours. The amount of weeks for which the trainee needs help depends on the origin of the problem, but mostly they are back on track after 2-3 weeks. 
You’re always welcome to join on Sunday to see the cohort of your trainee. Finally, it’s desirable to meet your pupil at least one time in real-life.
