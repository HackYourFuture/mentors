# Introduction
Some students need additional support throughout the course as the speed of our program is a challenge for them. That’s exactly what you will give them as a coding mentor. You will do that by making +/- 2 video calls during the week.  
In [this document](video-call-guide.md) a structure will be given to help you give the right support. 

## Practical information
You will have around two video calls each week that you plan in together with the student. Normally a call lasts for approximately two hours. It’s depending on the origin of the problem how many weeks the student needs help, but mostly they are back on track after 2-3 weeks. 
You’re always welcome to join on Sunday to see the class of the student you help and it’s desirable to meet your pupil at least one time in real-life.
