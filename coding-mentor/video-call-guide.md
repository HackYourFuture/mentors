# Video calls

This framework consists of 4 points that will help you structure the call you have with the student.

**1) Assessing which concepts they are struggling with.** 
Before you start, it’s good to know where the student is in the curriculum. That will give you an indication of the knowledge of the student. In our curriculum you can check which prior modules the student has had. Some of our students already have experience in IT so it is always good to ask about their prior knowledge.
After having an indication of the level of coding you can assess what the difficult concepts are. A trick to do so is to ask the student which topics he/she finds difficult and let them explain those concepts as much as they can. By trying to  explain the concepts themselves you get a good indication what and where knowledge is missing. 

**2) Recapping these concepts by explaining and using examples of code**
This step is the most time consuming. After having made an indication of the difficult subjects you need to work on them together. 

In HYF we use ‘the four E’s’ as a framework to help the student understand a concept. Those E’s are: Explanation, Example, Exercise and Essence. We provide them for every (large) concept in the lesson plans (you can find them in our curriculum). We think they represent the most important parts of understanding a certain topic. Feel free to use this format as much as you like.

    **Explanation** 
- To start with you can write down all difficult subjects and go through them one by one.
- You can use the readings that are provided every week for the student. By going through the reading together you know how the concept is explained and the student sees it one more time. Ask frequently if they still get everything and (let them) summarise the content in easy English. The reason for this: “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” -Albert Einstein.
- After running through the readings you can think of another way to explain the concept. Maybe a (different) metaphor will help the student understand it better. Or you know a good explanation from youtube that you can recommend. Ask (again) if the student can explain the subject themselves. 


    **Example/exercise**
- For some examples you can take a look at the homework. They already made those questions, but going through them again together is a good practise. You can ask the student what happens in the code. If you change some things, what will be different in the output? You can never use the ‘what will happen if I change this...’ question too much. 
- Next to the homework exercises, you can find of them on the internet. By searching for them take their prior knowledge in advance.

	**Essence**
- Showing the essence of the concept is important to motivate your pupil in trying to understand the subject. The easiest way of doing so is by giving examples on how you used it in the past (on your work). _You can explain the essence of the concept by giving the global intuition behind it, how/why did people think of this concept and what is the use in broad terms?_

**3) Supporting them with their homework **

Homework is very important within HYF. On average it takes about 20 to 30 hours a week to make it. All students get personal feedback on their homework and they need to implement that feedback afterwards. Depending on the difficulties that the student faces, you can support them in getting their work finished on time and with understanding of the subjects. 
As already mentioned above: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do not to do the homework for them, but help them with structuring the assignments. </span>

A few tips on how you can help the student:

- ‘Divide and conquer’ is a very useful method that many of us use to tackle a problem. Divide the main problem into smaller (solvable problems). It takes experience to distillate sub-problems out of the main problem so doing that together is very beneficial for the coding skills of the student.

- Structure the question. Ask the question: ‘What is expected from you in this assignment?’.  Rewriting the assignment together can already help a lot.  
Example: 

	Original:
	Write a function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers.
	
	Rewritten: 	
	Write a function that:
	*   has as input an array of numbers 
	*   calculates the sum of all the numbers in that array
	*   returns the result

- Don’t touch their computer / write code yourself. 

- How to search for solutions online? Using the write keywords is a very important skill. 


**4) Making a plan together.**
For almost all of us time management is hard. Therefore It can be very useful to make a realistic planning for that week together with the student. 

A simple framework you can use to help your pupil is:
1. Creating an overview on what needs to be done by writing down every task. 
2. Break a big task into smaller chunks to have a better insight in what needs to be done. (see ‘divide and conquer’ on the page above)
3. Give a time indication per task.
4. Prioritise every task.
5. Set a realistic deadline for every task in a logical order.
6. Stick to the planning and evaluate afterwards how it went.
