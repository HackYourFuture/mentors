## Preparation
1. Watch/screen the pre-recorded lecture.
2. Gather all the questions that the students submit in the class channel on Slack. Divide the questions per topic, so you can cover them thematically.
Have a look at the preperation exercise in the weekly homework. All students try to solve the exercise before the class. During the class, you'll discuss their different answers and struggles.
3. Open a [Jitsi meeting](https://meet.jit.si/) (make sure your dropbox is empty).
4. Start the Jitsi recording. 
5. Share the link to the meeting in the class channel on Slack.
6. Make sure students have muted their mic and switched on their video. When someone has a question, they can use the chat-function or ‘raise a hand’ function.
7. To increase interactivity, students can also ask their questions right away by unmuting their mic. Of course, only if their internet speed allows it. Make sure all students put their real name as their account name.

## During the session
1. A member of the coreteam joins to check if everybody is there, and will help you open the call / break the ice.
2. Is it your first time teaching this class? Introduce yourself briefly (how did you learn programming, where do you live and work, what are your hobbies). 
3. Share the planning with the class: 
- Questions about last week's homework
- Discuss answers on Preperation exercise
- Questions about this week’s lecture per topic
- Have a look at next week’s homework
- The end
4. As soon as you start explaining, make sure you share your screen.
5. Ask about the homework from last week (the deadline just passed). Are there any questions?
6. Discuss the preperation exercise. You can do this in multiple ways. 

(A) Do the exercise together with the students. They tell you what you have to write. 

(B) Ask a student to show their solution (screensharing) and discuss it in class.

7. Go over all the questions that students have submitted per topic. 
8. If you prepared an exercise, this is the time to do it :)
9. Take a look at the homework for next week with the students. Don’t answer the questions, but give them some small hints.
10. Before closing the call, ask if there are any questions.
11. Share the recordings in the class channel.  

### How to respond to questions
As you know, the students must hand in at least one question. The quality of the questions differs a lot. Here are a few tips on dealing with the questions:
- Let the student explain their question and why they struggle before starting with the answer. This allows you to get a better insight in what question they have.
- If a question is unrelated to this week's topics or an earlier topic, either save the question for last, or solely say it’s a good question, but that they don’t need to know the answer for now. Such questions can be intimidating for students that are struggling more with the core concepts, and it is important to focus on the material of our curriculum and to not mix up weeks. If one student is ahead of the rest, you can help them after the call and optionally give extra exercises. 
- Sometimes, a student submits an easy and googleable question. You’re not there to answer those questions; on the other hand you don’t want to create an atmosphere where students are afraid to ask dumb questions. In a situation like this, you can ask the student how they would solve it themself. As a joke, you can use [this](https://lmgtfy.app/) site (LetMeGoogleThatForYou). 
- Let other students try to answer the questions. First ask if someone had the same question, if not eveyone rpeplies with yes, there must be somebody that could help you out.
- Ask if the question is answered before you move on to the next, and give a small summary of the lessons learned. 

### Creating student engagement
Student interaction in class is important to ‘stay on the same page’ and to make sure the students get attention in the lecture.
A big challenge of teaching in general is student engagement. This challenge only gets harder in an online environment. In this paragraph, we gathered the best practises to help you make the Q&A more interactive. 

#### Flip the classroom 
You can engage students by asking them questions. 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz1nNh1kwWc&feature=youtu.be&t=2480&ab_channel=HackYourFuture) you can see one of the HYF mentors, Wilgert, using this trick. This teaching method is very simple:
- Find out what concepts students need to learn that week (check the lesson plan for that week). You can also choose a question from the “Exercises” sections of the lesson plan.
- Ask a question about (one of) those concepts.  Example: "Can you please explain subject X?". Or show a piece of code and ask “What would happen if I change this?”
- Pick a random student to answer the question. If you taught the same class in previous modules, you tend to notice the students who need to practice explaining / English speaking. 
- Important note: Some students are very afraid to make mistakes. Keep emphasising that making a mistake is not bad. 
- Always start with a positive point, like “You’re doing great so far!”
- Clap after they solve the problem. Perhaps also ask others to turn on the mic and clap. It is very motivating.

#### Summary at the end of the class
Another trick that you can use is to ask for a summary of the Q&A session itself at the end of the call. Please announce this at the beginning of your lectures, so the students know what they’re up for. It doesn’t have to be a detailed and complete summary, just a brief sum-up of the addressed in your lecture. 

#### The expert in the class
When a student comes up with a question, always ask the class if someone knows (part of) the answer. Make sure you always compliment a student who helps out, even if the answer is wrong. Replying with: “That’s a good start”; “Interesting way of thinking”; “I can see why you might think that” or “Thanks for sharing your thoughts” helps to create a safer environment where students are more likely to open up. 
Interesting? [Here](https://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2014/01/06/fp_mccaffrey_sticking.html) you can read more about replying to students' answers.  

#### Make an exercise
We know that practising is an essential part of the learning process. Especially in coding. 
Doing exercises during class not only helps the students to understand the subject, it will also create an more active engagement of the students.
There are multiple ways to implement exercises into your online Q&A session. 

ONE:
- Make or find a small exercise that will take 10 minutes maximum to solve.
- Let the students make the exercise on their own computer.
- Students hand-in their solutions via a direct message to you on slack.
- You can show a couple of answers anonymously and ask if the answers are (not) correct. Let the students point out the mistakes and how to solve them. 

TWO:
- Make or find a small exercise that will take 10 minutes maximum to solve.
- Share the exercise on your screen and ask students what you should do to solve it.
- Let them be ‘your hands’. Ask: ‘what should I type/do?’ ‘Should I delete/add/change this or that?’ ‘Will this code work, or is there a bug?’ 

Please share your exercises in the corresponding lesson plan on our GitHub, so other teachers can use it as well.
