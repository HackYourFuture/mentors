# introduction
Based on the reading material and the [HYF video's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkK246iKcOAvsL0SI_6n3eA) , students have to submit at least one question for [the Q&A session](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/mentors/blob/main/online-teaching/Q-and-A-session.md) every Sunday at 12:00. They will hand it in on slack in a thread on their class channel. Answering those questions will be the main goal of the session on Sunday.

The Thursday before the start of every module, Tjebbe will host a call at 20:00 to introduce all the mentors that are involved to eachother and to discuss the details of this module. You'll get a google calendar invite for this meeting.

Every Monday at 18:00 till 18:30 an evaluation session about yesterday's class is hosted. Tjebbe will invite you via a google calendar invite for this meeting. Everybody shares in +/- 5 minutes their experiences and afterwards we can discuss different aspects of online teaching or get an update of the current situation of HYF.
