# introduction
Based on the reading material and the [HYF video's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkK246iKcOAvsL0SI_6n3eA), students must submit at least one question for [the Q&A session](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/mentors/blob/main/online-teaching/Q-and-A-session.md), every Sunday at 12:00. They hand it in on Slack, in a thread on their class channel. Answering those questions is the main goal of the Sunday sessions.

The Thursday before the start of every module, Joséphine will host a call at 20:00 to introduce all the mentors involved to each other, and to discuss the details of this module. You'll get a google calendar invite for this meeting.

Every Sunday at 15:00, an evaluation session about the Q&A's is hosted. Joséphine will invite you via a google calendar for this meeting. Everybody shares their experience for +/- 5 minutes; afterwards, we can discuss different aspects of online teaching or get an update of the current situation of HYF.
