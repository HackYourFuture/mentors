# Introduction

As Bill Gates said: “We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.” At HackYourFuture we agree with Bill. Feedback works. 
The trainees know if they’re on the right track and they learn efficiently by implementing feedback on their assignments. 
The mentors get an overview on the concepts that may need some extra attention in class, and they see which trainee need extra help.

In this document, a framework is drafted to help you review the assignments of HackYourFuture trainees. 


# Assignment flow 
The Thursday before the start of each module, Joséphine hosts a call at 20:00 to introduce to each other all the mentors and to discuss the details of the module. You'll get a google calendar invite for this meeting.

Trainees hand in their assignments via [GitHub](https://github.com/HackYourAssignment). In both cases, they must do this weekly before the deadline on Tuesday, 23:59.

You'll get assigned 3 to 5 trainees whom you will provide feedback with. Together with those trainees, you can decide to video-call, add comments to the PR or chat via Slack for the review of their work. This will take +/- 4 hours per week. Once you’ve helped out multiple times on the same module, it will  take less time of course. Within two weeks (after the hand-in deadline), you need to approve the final code (with feedback implemented). If you're not able to make one of the deadlines, please share it as soon as possible in the module chat on Slack, so Joséphine can arrange something else. 

For a more detailed explanation, have a look at the [Review Guide](./review-guide.md).
