# Project Supervisor
Throughout the curriculum, we have a couple of projects to mentor trainees about the way a software is built. It also allows them to build bigger things and see what a bigger code base looks like.

Every project is a little different and requires something slightly different from the project supervisor.

## Browsers group project
In the [Browsers module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers), there is a [group project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers/blob/main/PROJECT.md). The goal of the group project is to combine and revise everything the trainees have learned so far (HTML / CSS / Git / JS) into one big website, while learning how to work as a group.

To be a project supervisor requires the following:
- Availability for 2 Sundays (from 12:00 - 16:00ish). On the first Sunday, the groups are made and the project supervisor introduces the project and talks about how they want to approach working together. On the second Sunday, the groups present their projects and are given feedback. We would like the supervisors to also give feedback to other groups.
- Availability during the week between those two Sundays for meetings, tech help, checking in.
- It is up to the project supervisor how often they meet, but we suggest either a short daily meeting, or at least once per two days to discuss progress. This does not have to be during the working day.
- Be available for technical issues during the week. Trainees should be encouraged to ask for help during the project from their group and you, as tech lead.
- This is their first time working in a group, so expect to answer questions about git issues / branches / merging / code reviews.

## Using API's and React individual project
In both the [Using API's](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs) and the [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React) modules, the final test is an individual project. In the [first project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/Week3/README.md) (Using API's), we check if the trainee is proficient enough in JavaScript to start learning the more advanced modules. In the [second one](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React/blob/master/week4/README.md) (React), we want to make sure they are ready for the last module of the curriculum: the final project.

Both projects have the same structure. Each trainee has a week to build a project on their own, that adheres to some requirements (see module repo for details).

The role of the project supervisor here is to be available for questions for a couple of trainees in the cohort. It is important to walk the fine line of providing support without writing their project for them. 

We also expect you to have a couple of check-ins with the trainees to see how they are getting on and to make sure they don't get stuck. This can be just a Slack message or a stand-up with the group. That is up to you.

At the end of the project, trainees have a tech interview with the education director, to determine if they pass this part of the curriculum.
