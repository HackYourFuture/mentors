# Project leader
During the curriculum we have a couple of projects that will teach the students about the way software is built. It also allows them to build bigger things and see what a bigger code base looks like.

Every project is a little different and requires something slightly different from the project leader.

## Browsers group project
In the [Browsers module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers) there is a [group project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers/blob/main/PROJECT.md). The goal of the group project is to combine and revise everything they have learned so far (HTML / CSS / Git / JS) into one big website while learning how to work as a group.

To be a project leader here requires the following:
- Availability for 2 Sundays (from 12:00 - 16:00ish). The first Sunday the groups will be made and the project leader will introduce the project and talk about how they want to approach working together. The second Sunday the groups will present their projects and will be given feedback. We would like the mentors there as well to give feedback to other groups.
- Availability during the week between those 2 Sundays for meetings / tech help / checking in.
- It is a up to the project leader how often to meet, but we suggest either a short daily meeting or at least once per 2 days to discuss progress. This does not have to be during the working day.
- Be available for technical issues during the week. They should be encouraged to ask for help during the project from their group and you as tech lead
- This will be their first time working in a group so expect to answer questions about git issues / branches / merging / code reviews.

## Using API's and React individual project
In both the [Using API's](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Using-APIs) and the [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React/blob/master/week4/README.md) modules the final test is an individual project. In the [first project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/Week3/README.md) (Using API's) we check if the student is proficient enough in JavaScript to start learning the more advanced modules. In the [second one](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React/blob/master/week4/README.md) (React)we want to make sure that they are ready for the last module of the curriculum: The final project.

Both projects have the same structure. Each student has a week to build a project on their own that adheres to some requirements (see module repo for details).

The role of the project leader here is to be available for questions for a couple of students in the class. It is important to walk the fine line of providing support without writing their project for them. 

We also expect you to have a couple of checkins with the students to see how they are getting on and make sure they don't get stuck. This can be just a slack message or a standup with the group, that is up to you.

At the end of the project they will have a tech interview with Rob to determine if they pass this part of the curriculum.
