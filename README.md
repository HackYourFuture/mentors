# Introduction for new mentors

![mentor](assets/mentor.jpg)

Welcome to Hack Your Future. We really appreciate that you're interested in being part of our community. In this RePo we want to give you an overview of the different volunteer positions available. By volunteering you contribute to our main goal: help students gain the necessary skills to find a job as a programmer. Hack Your Future has now helped over 130 students find work as a programmer. This is only possible with the support of you: our volunteers.

## Curriculum
![theprogram](assets/program.png)

To facilitate the learning process, volunteers - together with HYF staff - have developed a curriculum, which you can find [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum). The complete 7-month program is divided into different modules, each building on the one before. We encourage you to have a look at the curriculum and think about which modules connect most to your professional experience. Another useful resource is the [Student Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzPC7m9vOCb0h4EFCqLChw1L096XcbJv3dK3k7VooQM/edit?usp=sharing) which we give to students on their introduction day. It provides an overview of our program and might answer some of the questions you still have after reading this sheet. 

## Structure
Every two months a new class of +/- 15 students starts the course. This means that we have 4 classes (+/- 60 students) in different stages of the curriculum at any given point. HackYourFuture is mostly self study and you can find the structure for our students [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUaEbxMQTyljAPFsWIbbLwwvvIXZ0VCHmCCN8RaeVIc/edit?usp=sharing). On Sunday (12:00 to 14:00) we host online Q&A sessions about the homework and the concepts of that week for every class. 
As a volunteer you’ll help out per module. All modules (except React) are three weeks long. So, as a volunteer you commit for three weeks to HYF. It’s up to you how often you want to help out in a module. 
We need at least three mentors for every module. Check the table at the top for an overview and explanation of the different volunteering roles.  

## Roles
| Role              | Topic                                 | Time estimation per week |
| ------            | --------------------------------------| --------------- |
| [Homework support](./homework-support)  | As a homework assistant you will check and provide feedback on the homework of the students and optionally revise their tests. Feedback should be provided within a week after homework has been submitted.| 6 hours. Flexible |
| [(Online) teacher](./online-teaching)   | During the week you will help provide feedback on the homework. On Sunday you will host a Q&A session for the class that’s following the module you teach. To become a teacher you must first have experience as Homework Support. Afterwards you’ll help out a more experienced teacher for a module so you learn how to lead a session.  | 3 hours Sunday, 2 hours preparation, 2 hours homework support|
| [Personal mentor](./coding-mentor)      | Some of our students need additional support throughout the course to be ready for their first job. This is exactly what you will do as a mentor. We ask you to organize at least one, but preferably two video calls a week of at least an hour when assigned to a student. |4 hours. Flexible |
| [Project leader](./project-leader)      | There are multiple short projects in the curriculum that require guidance. As project leader you will provide this guidance by acting like a Tech lead / Product owner / Scrum master in one | 7 hours, 1 week |
| [Post Graduation Package](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/post-grad-ed/blob/master/mentoringpgp.md)        |  As a mentor you will work closely with two gradautes who are preparing for their first internship. You will support them in a 4 to 8 week during program.           | 3 hours. Flexible |
| [Fellowship](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Fellowship) |  Like the Post Graduation Package, th Fellowship is an extracurricular project. On [this](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/fellowship/) website you can find all the info you need.            | 3 hours. Flexible |

## Communication
Most of our communication is done via Slack. This is the place where we ask you if you can help out in a certain module and where you can keep in touch with both students and other mentors.
Next to that we have channels for every class and the main goal here is that we support students with questions/their homework during the week. If you are not in Slack yet, ask Tjebbe :information_desk_person:

## What we expect from you

For an overview and explanation of our core-values, check out [this](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/values) RePo. 

For you, the mentors, it's important to know that you're a role-model for our students. They can learn by example to:
* stick to deadlines
* Communicate proffesionally and on time
* Be pro-active 

## Conclusion
We hope that by reading this you have a better idea of what it means to volunteer at Hack Your Future. If you have any questions, you can always send us an email at tjebbe@hackyourfuture.net or (once you have been added to our Slack channels) send us a Slack message.

Looking forward to working with you!
