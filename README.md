# INTRODUCTION FOR NEW MENTORS
Welcome to Hack Your Future. We really appreciate that you are interested in being part of our community. In this RePo we want to give you an overview of the different volunteer positions available. By volunteering you contribute to our main goal: help students gain the necessary skills to find a job as a programmer. Hack Your Future has now helped over 130 students find work as a programmer. This is only possible with the support of you: our volunteers.

## Curriculum
To facilitate the learning process, volunteers - together with HYF staff - have developed a curriculum, which you can find [here](www.github.com/hackyourfuture). The complete 7-month program is divided into different modules, each building on the one before. We encourage you to have a look at the curriculum and think about which modules connect most to your professional experience. Another useful resource is the [Student Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzPC7m9vOCb0h4EFCqLChw1L096XcbJv3dK3k7VooQM/edit?usp=sharing) which we give to students on their introduction day. It provides an overview of our program and might answer some of the questions you still have after reading this sheet. 

## Structure
Every two months a new class of +/- 15 students starts the course. This means that we have 4 classes (+/- 60 students) in different stages of the curriculum at any given point. HackYourFuture is mostly self study and you can find the structure for our students [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUaEbxMQTyljAPFsWIbbLwwvvIXZ0VCHmCCN8RaeVIc/edit?usp=sharing). 
As a volunteer you’ll help out per module. All modules (except React) are three weeks long. So, as a volunteer you commit for three weeks to HYF. It’s up to you how often you want to help out in a module. 
On Sunday (12:00 to 14:00) we host online Q&A sessions about the homework and the concepts of that week for every class.
