# Review process 

## before you start 

Students hand in their homework (a link to their GitHub repository) on a board in the list for that week. [Here](https://trello.com/invite/b/U1gK8Q1c/9007759b1ba5cf4d8468301210841b3a/feedback-assignments) is an invitation for the board. 
## Review process
1. Click on a card to see the link to their repo and/or sites that the students had to build. 
2. label the card with: ‘Review in Process’
3. The feedback on the code can be given in a comment on their card.
4. Label the card with: ‘Reviewed’.
5. If the student needs to make adjustments to pass the homework you add the label: ‘Needs work’
6. When the student implemented the requested changes, remove the label ‘needs work’

## Best practices 
There are five points of which we think are essential for good feedback in HackYourFuture.

### 1. Positivity
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes. But it’s very important to give  positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the student more confident. We’re also learning from what we did well.

### 2. Specific
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible, so the student knows which part of the code needs improvement.

### 3. Suggestions
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. In this way the student will have an idea on how to improve the code. You push him/her in the right direction. Keep in mind that there is a balance between suggestions and self study. Giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do. 

### 4. Balance in amount of feedback
Too little comments and a student doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from, too much feedback and the student is overwhelmed by all the information. 
As a rule of thumb we say that a normal review is somewhere between the 10 and 15 comments. 
When you have the feeling that a student needs more guidance, feel free to contact him or her on Slack to plan an online call!

### 5. Summary at the beginning
When you finished your review, it’s recommended to write a small summary at the top where you: 
- Give a compliment to the student
- Let them know if they need to make changes 
- Reflect upon the topics for that week  and if you think (s)he understands them.
