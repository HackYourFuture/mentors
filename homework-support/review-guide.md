# Homework Review Process

## Before you start
1. [This](https://github.com/HackYourHomework) is the github account where our students submit their homework. Per module a specific RePo is created where students will make a PR.  Please send your username to Joséphine on Slack, so she adds you to the organization. 
2. [This](https://github.com/HackYourHomework/homework-solutions) is our **secret** RePo with the homeworksolutions. This makes your life as a reviewer a lot easier. If the answers to the module you're helping with are not there, feel free to add yours! 
3. You get assigned 3 to 5 students at the start of the module in a slack conversation, with all the mentors for that module. You are responsible for reviewing their work for the duration of the module.
4. Please don't hesitate to contact Joséphine or the class mentor if you are facing any issues. We are here to help you out!  

## Review process
As mentionned earlier, you have the freedom to decide with your students of the way to communicate with them about their code. You can do video calls or place comments to the PR.

We have found that the best approach is to start a group message with 'your' students on Slack, and agree together on the way of communication. There, you can keep the whole group informed of availability and updates.

### Video calls
If you choose to do video calls, there're two options. Individual calls or a group call. 

If you're doing individual calls, you go over the students' homework together. Make sure the student understands your comments! You can let them share their screen and ask them to explain their code. At the end of the call, it must be clear for the student what changes must be made to get approval of the homework. 

A group call requires a bit more preparation, but you only have to do it once a week, which saves some time as well. Go through all the homework before the call and write down your comments. During the call, you can start with addressing the common mistakes, so you can refer back to this once you go over individual homework. The advantage of this structure is that students can learn from mistakes that others made and that they can help eachother out with answers. 

### Comments to the PR
[This](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/mentors/blob/main/homework-support/review-in-written.md) is a step-by-step guide, made by Jim Cramer, for a written review on a PR. You can use it as a guideline, but it's not mandatory.

### Timeline feedback
| Days | Activities |
| --- | --- |
|Tuesday (week 1)  | Deadline for the students to hand in their first version   |
|Wednesday (week 1) - Tuesday (week 2)  | Mentor provides students with feedback  |
| Wednesday (week 2) - Tuesday (week 3)  | Students improve homework and mentor evaluates improvements   |
| Wednesday (week 3) | Core-team member Homework Approval Check. At this point every PR needs to be approved. |

### Labels 
It is important for the core-team to have up-to-date info about the status of the homework. This is why we expect you to work with two labels on the PR of the student.

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
|no label  |not reviewed yet   |
|In proccess  |mentor is review process for this homework   |
|Needs work   |reviewed, but student needs to implement feedback  |
|Approved   |reviewed and homework has been approved   |

Here is an example of this in action.

This makes it easy to see which PR is still being worked on and which one has been approved.

## Best practices 
There are five points we think are essential to good feedback in HackYourFuture.

### 1. Positivity
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes, but it’s important to give positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the student more confident. We also learn from what we did well.

### 2. Specific
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible, so the student knows which part of the code needs improvement.

### 3. Suggestions
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. In this way, the student will have ideas on how to improve the code. You push them in the right direction. Keep in mind the balance between suggestions and self-study; giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do.

### 4. Balance in amount of feedback
Too little comments and a student doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from, too much feedback and the student is overwhelmed by all the information. 
As a rule of thumb, we say that a normal review is somewhere between 10 and 15 comments. When you have a feeling that a student needs more guidance, feel free to contact them on Slack to plan an online call! If a student does everything well, tease them with more advanced topics!

### 5. Summary at the beginning
When you finished your review, we recommend to write a small summary at the top, where you: 
- give a compliment to the student;
- let them know if they need to make changes;
- reflect upon the topics for that week and whether you think they understood well.
