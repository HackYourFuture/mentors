# Homework Review Process

## Before you start
1. [This](https://github.com/HackYourHomework) is the github account where our students submit their homework. Please send your username to Tjebbe on Slack, then he will add you to the organization. 
2. You get assigned 3 to 5 students before the start of the module. 

## Review process
As said before you have the freedom to decide with your students on the way of communication with them. You can do video calls, place comments to the PR
or chat via slack. 

The best is to start a groep message with 'your' students on Slack and agree together on the way of feedback. 

video calls
If you choose to do video calls, there're 2 options. Individual calls or a group call. 
If you're doing individual calls you go over the student's homework together. Make sure that the student makes notes on the comments that you have. 
You can let him/her share his/her screen and ask to explain the code he/she wrote. At the end of the call it must be clear to the student what changes has to be made to get approval of the homework. 
A group call requires a bit more preparation. (but you only have to do it once a week, which saves some time as well) 
Go through all the homeworks before the call and write down the comments that you have. During the call you can address the common mistakes first, so you can refer to them once you go over every induvidual homework. 
The advantage of this structure is that students can learn from mistakes that others made and that they can help eachother out with answers. 

2. comments to the PR

3. chat via slack. 

### timline feedback
1. Tuesday (week 1) -->  deadline for the students to hand in their first version
2. Wednesday (week 1) - Tuesday (week 2) --> Mentor provides students with feeback
3. Wednesday (week 2) - Tuesday (week 3) --> Students improve  homework and mentor evaluates improvements
4. Wednesday (week 3) --> Core-team member Homework Approval Check

### Labels 
It is important for the core-team to have up to date info about the status of the homework. This is why we expect you to work with two labels on the PR of the student. 
|no label  |not reviewed yet   |
|needs work   |reviewed, but student needs to implement feedback  |
|approved   |reviewed, and homework has been approved   |
## Best practices 
There are five points of which we think are essential for good feedback in HackYourFuture.

### 1. Positivity
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes. But it’s very important to give  positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the student more confident. We’re also learning from what we did well.

### 2. Specific
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible, so the student knows which part of the code needs improvement.

### 3. Suggestions
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. In this way the student will have an idea on how to improve the code. You push him/her in the right direction. Keep in mind that there is a balance between suggestions and self study. Giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do. 

### 4. Balance in amount of feedback
Too little comments and a student doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from, too much feedback and the student is overwhelmed by all the information. 
As a rule of thumb we say that a normal review is somewhere between the 10 and 15 comments. 
When you have the feeling that a student needs more guidance, feel free to contact him or her on Slack to plan an online call!

### 5. Summary at the beginning
When you finished your review, it’s recommended to write a small summary at the top where you: 
- Give a compliment to the student
- Let them know if they need to make changes 
- Reflect upon the topics for that week  and if you think (s)he understands them.
