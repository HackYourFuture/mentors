# Homework Review Process

## Before you start
1. [This](https://github.com/HackYourHomework) is the github account where our students submit their homework. Please send your username to Tjebbe on Slack, then he will add you to the organization. 
2. You get assigned 3 to 5 students before the start of the module. 

## Review process
As said before you have the freedom to decide with your students on the way of communication with them. You can do video calls, add comments to the PR or chat via slack. The best is to start a groep message on Slack and agree together on the way of feedback. Within two weeks (after the hand-in deadline) the final code needs to be approved by you. That means that you put the label 'approved' on the trello card(HTML/CSS module) or on the PR(all the other modules).

### timline feedback
1. Tuesday (week 1) -->  deadline for the students to hand in their first version
2. Wednesday (week 1) - Tuesday (week 2) --> Mentor provides students with feeback
3. Wednesday (week 2) - Tuesday (week 3) --> Students improves homework and mentor evaluates improvements
3. Wednesday (week 3) --> Core-team member Homework Approval Check

## Best practices 
There are five points of which we think are essential for good feedback in HackYourFuture.

### 1. Positivity
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes. But it’s very important to give  positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the student more confident. We’re also learning from what we did well.

### 2. Specific
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible, so the student knows which part of the code needs improvement.

### 3. Suggestions
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. In this way the student will have an idea on how to improve the code. You push him/her in the right direction. Keep in mind that there is a balance between suggestions and self study. Giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do. 

### 4. Balance in amount of feedback
Too little comments and a student doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from, too much feedback and the student is overwhelmed by all the information. 
As a rule of thumb we say that a normal review is somewhere between the 10 and 15 comments. 
When you have the feeling that a student needs more guidance, feel free to contact him or her on Slack to plan an online call!

### 5. Summary at the beginning
When you finished your review, it’s recommended to write a small summary at the top where you: 
- Give a compliment to the student
- Let them know if they need to make changes 
- Reflect upon the topics for that week  and if you think (s)he understands them.
