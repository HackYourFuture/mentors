# Introduction

As Bill Gates said: “We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.” At HackYourFuture we agree with Bill. Feedback works. 
The students know if they’re on the right track and they learn efficiently by implementing feedback on their homework. 
The teachers get an overview on the concepts that may need some extra attention in class and they see which students need some extra help. 
In this document a framework is given that can help you review homework of students at HackYourFuture. 
As you know, volunteering at HYF is module based. If you’re going to help out in a module as homework support you’ll review around 4 or 5 homework submissions per week as long as that module lasts (normally 3 weeks). This will take +/- 4 hours per week. Once you’ve helped out multiple times in the same module and you get to know the exercises it will of course take less time.

# Homework flow 
The Thursday before the start of every module, Tjebbe will host a call at 20:00 to introduce all the mentors that are involved to each other and to discuss the details of the module. You'll get a google calendar invite for this meeting.

The code of the students has to be reviewed within a week after the deadline (every Tuesday) so the students can improve their work as soon as possible.
After implementing the requested changes the reviewer has to check if the improvements fit the requirements of the assignment and if so, approve the homework.  

You'll be asked to review a fixed amount of PR's a week. Let's say the class consists of 12 students and there're 3 mentors helping out, everyone takes 4 PR's a week. If you cannot make this, please communicate this ASAP with Tjebbe to prevent homework being reviewed too late or one mentor doing all the work. 

# Review process
In the first module (HTML/CSS) students will hand in their homework via Trello. Starting from Javascript 1, week 1, students need to hand in their homework via [GitHub](https://github.com/HackYourHomework). In both cases they've to do this every week before the deadline on Tuesday at 23:59.
